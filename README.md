# Ionic 6 Angular 14 with RxDB sample

I've tried to find a working example of RxDB using the latest Ionic 6/Angular 14 but failed to find it.
So, I made this example. Hope this will help you get started playing RxDB with the latest Ionic 6 and Angular 14.



This is an example usage of RxDB with Ionic 6 Angular 14 as sample on RxDB official repo.
It implements a simple heroes-list which can be filled by the user.

## Try it out
1. clone the whole [RxDB-repo](https://github.com/rmyndharis/ionic6-angular-rxdb)
2. go into project `cd ionic6-angular-rxdb`
3. run `npm install`
4. run `ionic serve`
5. Test playing rxdb

Enjoy,
